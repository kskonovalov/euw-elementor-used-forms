# Used Elementor Forms plugin for WordPress

Simple way to check all Elementor forms

### Purpose:
Simple way to check all Elementor forms (Elementor Pro Form widget) through the site.
Out of the box there's no simple way to find all the forms created with Elementor, as they're just widgets (same as all other widgets).
This plugin helps to find all forms, pages where they're used and some important settings like reCaptcha, Honeypot, Saving form submissions to the DB enabled.
