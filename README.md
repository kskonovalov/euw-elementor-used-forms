# Used Elementor Forms plugin for WordPress

### Purpose:
Currently, there's no simple way to find all forms created with Elementor, as they're just widgets (same as all other widgets).
Plugin helps to find all forms, where they're used and some important settings 

### TODO:
* Show all forms
* For each form show:
    * form title
    * page 
    * receiver
    * acceptance?
    * captcha?
    * honeypot?
